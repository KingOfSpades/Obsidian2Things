# Obsidian 2 Things3
A simple [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) plugin to sync todo's to [Things](http://culturedcode.com)

# Why
The 'Single Inbox' principle rings trough to me. All your work (todo's) in one place! I created this plug-in to automaticly sync open todo's from Obsidian to things. Todo's will appear as new task's with a link to the page they were created on. The idea is not to create todo's from Obsidian but to create little todo's on pages or reminders to finish up a Obsidian entry with more information. Example? :

```
- [ ] Finish writing this README
```

# ðŸš¨ Disclaimer
Use this plug-in at you own risk. Backup your vault before testing it. Even better, set-up TimeMachine or any other backup soloution on your computer.
